# Sentiment Analysis LSTM model with Sagemaker and PyTorch

Repository contains end to end sentiment analysis model creation (using LSTM),
and deployment steps to create a simple functional web app in front of the created model, hosted on SageMaker endpoint.

All the steps are documented in the [notebook](SageMaker Project.ipynb).

Techologies used:
Python 3.6 with PyTorch library to Machine Learning
AWS:
